Django Project

Hi everyone, 

I updated the page template and fixed some problems with accounts.

I copied the project to another fold and tested it. It was working fine.

You can do the same. Copy and past in another directory and use the code below:
python manage.py makemigrations accounts
python manage.py makemigrations pages
python manage.py migration
python manage.py runserver
